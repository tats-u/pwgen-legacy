[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tats-u/pwgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tats-u/pwgen)

https://tats-u.github.io/pwgen/

In this generator, you can:

- Adjust the probabilities of appearance of alphabets & numbers & symbols.
- Adjust the length of generated passwords.
- Exclude uppercases or numbers or symbols from generated passwords.
- Customize maybe-contained symbols (except for white space)
- Copy generated passwords by a simple click.

You will be able to (can't for now though):

- Restrict the type of a character next to another charactor.
